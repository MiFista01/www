        <h3>Cutting board</h3>
        <p>The first cutting board was for a teacher from my old school. The second was a trial work to work with wood that had rotted a little and acquired its own unique pattern.</p>

        <h3>Pictures burned on plywood</h3>

        <h3>Plates</h3>
        <p>I also made 2 such plates in my life. The first one was made from wood, epoxy and cones. The second one is made of plywood with a thick veneer inserted into it.Both of them are rubbed with beeswax for better protection against moisture.</p>

        <h3>Rose</h3>
        <p>Here you see a rose in a Plexiglas pot. I made the shape of the petals by hand using a building hair dryer and gloves. Even the gloves didn't save me and I got burned, but I think it was worth it. This rose is gone as a gift to an old longtime friend.</p>
