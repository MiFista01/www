        <h3>White box</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we were told what a white box is and how to use it. Of all the subsequent methods, I like this one the most. I wrote the results in Excel, so I share with the program (my own) and the result</p>

        <h3>Black box</h3>
        <p>In this lesson, we were told what the black box method is. I liked this method the least because I can't see the code</p>
        <div class="file">
            <a href="projects/course3/testing/black_box.xlsx">Download excel black box</a>

        <h3>Pairwise</h3>
        <p>Pairwise testing took place in this lesson. We were told that this method can reduce the amount of testing. For this we used PICT. I share with you two files generated by PICT</p>

        <h3>JUnit</h3>
        <p>To learn how to work with the JUnit test method, I had to remember what Java is and how to work with it. The tests themselves were written quickly, but this was because the task was easy</p>

        <h3>UI - User Interface Testing</h3>
        <p>Next we test the UI of different sites. I chose hostiq because I used to use it. in this section, an excel file of the test result will be presented</p>

        <h3>Functional testing</h3>
        <p>This time we went through functional testing. For this type of test, we were shown how to use "selenium". This program is pretty easy to understand. Even had to help others</p>
