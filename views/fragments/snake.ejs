        <p>When we just started learning pygame, I thought with one classmate, "Why not make a snake?" and after that the project started. From the beginning, I didnâ€™t understand how to make the snake move like in the old days, but then I realized that I needed to make a screen by cells and move according to their coordinates. Due to the fact that one library stopped working to create an interface, I had to learn a new one. The new one was more comfortable and nicer. Therefore, I share the last version of the game and the results in the form of pictures</p>
